        <blockquote cite="http://blog.specialitalingerie.com.br">
        <p class="text">The seamless panty is, for sure, one of the <u>main</u> allies of women when it comes to composing looks that need <i>discretion.</i> <br>
        In addition to not marking clothes, the seamless panties are super comfortable, which makes them the most beloved option for Brazilian women.<br>
        <br>
        Made with thin and light materials, the seamless panty usually has a soft waistband. In general, this piece becomes practically<br>
        a second skin on the body. This is all due to the delicacy of the making and comfort felt by the fans of this lingerie. <br>
        <br>
        And beyond comfort? More advantages of seamless panties! <br>
        The seamless panty is amazing, that's because it becomes <br>invisible</b> under clothing. The absence of seams makes this lingerie<br>
        the most important piece of that tight look, either:</p>
            <ul class="topics">
                <li><i>Tight social pants for the work meeting </i></li>
                <li><i>A tight dress for that social event</i></li>
                <li><i>A tight legging to work out at the gym</i></li>
                <li><i>If you work in a hospital, it's perfect to wear under your white uniform.</i></li>
            </ul>
        <p class="text">Perhaps the biggest advantage of seamless panties is their <b>universality.</b> <br>
        This lingerie is suitable for any body type, for any type of hip and for any outfit you want to wear over it.<br>
        With different models, sizes, prints and colors, just choose. <br>
        <br>
        How to wear seamless panties? <br>
        The most important tip when it comes to seamless panties is to avoid models that are <b>too tight</b>. In addition to being uncomfortable,<br>
        the use of very tight panties defeats the fundamental purpose of this seamless lingerie: to ber <b>invisible</b> and not <b>mark</b> the body. <br>
        <br>
        See other great tips for you to hit the seamless panties and rock the look: <br>
        <br>
        <b>Consistency in the composition of the look:</b> Very tight clothes should not be used with panties with lace or details. <br> 
        Even if the panties are seamless, the details will mark the skin. <br>
        For these looks, opt for a plain, traditional seamless panty, ok? <br>
        <b>White, pastel or transparent looks:</b> Whenever you choose white clothes, pastel tones, transparent or light in general, <br>
        the seamless panties must have a neutral color, such as white, black and beige. This care is essential for the final result to be impeccable. <br>
        <b>Don't forget about your health:</b> Avoid panties as much as possible –<i> with or without seams</i> – made with thick fabrics or that can compromise <br>
        the ventilation. <br>
        The female genital region is delicate and needs to be treated with care and affection. Panties are an important <br>
        part responsible for protecting this region. In this sense, choosing pieces that protect without impeding ventilation is essential. <br>
        Very thick panties help <b>fungi and bacteria</b> to grow. Watch out for that, okay? <br><br>
        <b>In conclusion… </b><br><br>
        With different models, sizes and colors, the seamless panties are the best friend of that <i>impeccable</i> look. <br>
        Look at your wardrobe with attention and affection and compose the perfect look with the right pieces. <br>
        Seamless panties bring several benefits, such as comfort and sophistication, regardless of whether you are going to <br>
        a social party, at a professional meeting or to the gym to work out.<br> 
        Always have a few pieces of seamless panties <b>available</b> in your wardrobe to rock wherever you are. <br>
