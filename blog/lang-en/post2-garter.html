        <blockquote cite="http://blog.specialitalingerie.com.br">
        <p class="text">When it comes to lingerie and sensuality, the garter belt is <b>always</b> there! <br>
        Symbol of feminine <i>lust and daring</i>, the garter belt stirs the imagination of men and women and is a fundamental suggestion <br>
        for those who <b>really</b> want to surprise in moments of intimacy! <br>
        But do you know how the garter belt came about? And better than that: <b>know how to use it to your advantage?</b>
        <br><br>
        <i>Garter belt: from French <s>cabarets</s> to your wardrobe</i> <br>
        The garter belt was first used by French cabaret dancers in the <i>19th century</i>. <br>
        At that time, girls used to wear a model of socks known as stockings, which <b>covered</b> almost <br>
        the entire leg and stopped at mid-thigh. As the <b>dancers</b> moved their legs a lot, the garter belt came up with the purpose of <br>
        keep her stockings in place and, little by little, left the <i><s>cabarets</i></s> to compose the look of women all over the <b>world.</b> <br>
        <br>
        <i>Why wear a garter belt? </i> <br>
        Because of its <b>history</b> and the way it is present in people's fantasies, <br>
        it is a <b>key piece</b> to compose a <i>femme fatale</i> look. It even seems like a contradiction, because at the same time that <br>
        partially covers the skin, brings an expression of sensuality to the woman's body that no other garment is able to bring. <br>
        If you want to <b>explore</b> your potential in intimacy and show mastery and security over your own body, start now <br>
        choosing the model that best suits you! <br>
        <br>
        What are the garter belt models? <br>
        <b>Remember:</b> in addition to being <i>sexy</i>, it is essential that you feel <i>comfortable</i>! <br>
        Models that have a wider front are generally more comfortable to wear and offer good coverage. <br>
        You can also choose between straps with 4 or 6 alloys and, of course, between the most varied colors. <br>
        To bet on the <b>tradition</b>, my tip is the black or red garter belt, to help you become even more <i>sassy!</i>
