            </figure>
        <blockquote cite="http://blog.specialitalingerie.com.br">
        <p class="text">The footless stocking is a wardrobe classic and an integral part of some of today's most sophisticated and seductive looks. <br>
        The footless stocking first appeared <i>centuries ago</i> and in some cases prevalent in <b>winter.</b> <br>
        With perfect conditions to warm the body and help improve blood circulation, footless stockings were common between <br>
        the 17th and 18th century.<br>
        <br>
        However, this piece was <b>rejected</b> by society between 1800 and early 1900. In fact, the footless stocking became<br>
        seen as an excessively <i>sensual</i> piece, which made it synonymous with lewdness and vulgarity. For this reason, for more than one <br>
        century the <s>call girls</s> were the only ones to socially use these stockings. <br>
        <br>
        The power of feminism and women's desire to be free, <b>without restrictions</b>, was crucial to saving this piece <br>
        about the mid-twentieth century, stockings have been part of the feminine look again, this time with more force <br>
        and with other functions, besides just warming up the female body in winter. <br>
        <br>
        The biggest advantage of this "sock", nowadays, is the sophistication and elegance that the footless stocking brings to any <i>look</i> of which <br>
        it is a part. <br>
        Models and occasions to use, creating breathtaking looks: <i>here you'll find everything about footless stocking.</i> <br>
        <br>
        The best occasions to wear the ⅞ sock, according to some fashion consultants, the footless stocking is very suitable for two specific occasions: <br>
            <ul class="topics">
                <li>Night Looks</li>
                <li>Sexy Looks</li>
            </ul>
        <p class="text">Parties and social evenings are considered the perfect time to create a beautiful, elegant and sophisticated <i>look</i> <br>
        with this stocking. The delicacy of it goes very well with dinners, social gatherings and going to the movies, for example. <br>
        <br>
        Another great time to wear the footless stocking and get the look right is that special <i>intimate night</i>. Assemble sexy looks with <br>
        the right stocking is essential to ensure that your anniversary, honeymoon or Valentine's Day night will be <b>unforgettable</b>.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Without fear of making mistakes:</b> Composing looks with the sock ⅞<br>
        <br>
        <i>For social events</i>, it is interesting to combine the ⅞ sock with fabrics with thick textures, such as leather and wool. Make use of this piece <br>
        in conjunction with a leather dress or skirt and a high-heeled shoe is a guarantee of success.<br>
        <br>
        Several celebrities have been using these looks and showing the elegance of a plain footless stocking with a thick coat on top, for example.<br>
        For intimate moments, the best option is to use the footless stocking in conjunction with a garter belt, corset or body harness.<br>
        <br>
        Unlike evening looks for social events, if the goal is to sensualize, you can opt for pieces with details. <br>
        Dragnet and lace are the most used models in the composition of sensual looks for intimate moments.<br>
        <br>
        For couples who like to play and let their imaginations run wild, wearing costumes with the footless stocking is the best alternative. <br>
        That's because, in addition to being sexy, the composition of the look with a costume encourages the couple's creativity.<br>
        <br>
        Stocking models <br>
        There are footless stocking of all types and for all tastes. But the most popular models are: <br>
            <ul class="topics">
                <li>Prints</li>
                <li>Standardized </li>
                <li>Plain </li>
                <li>Lace </li>
                <li>Draw </li>
            </ul>
        <p class="text"> Models with prints and patterns are more suitable for thin and tall women. That's because, with the legs <br>
        long and thin, the stocking  composes the look with greater sobriety.<br>
        <br>
        In the case of short women or with more rounded legs, it is best to use smooth models. <br>
        This indication is made because prints and patterns usually create the impression of reduced height and increased width, <br>
        I mean, if you're short or chubby, the last thing you want is to look even shorter or even chubby, right? <br>
        <br>
        Lacy stockings, fishnet stockings or any other details should be used with great care. This finish refers to the <br>
        corset stockings and lingerie in general. In that sense, make use of this footless stocking model only if your goal is <br>
        conquer the cat, ok?<br>
        <br>
        <b>Concluding</b><br>
        The footless stocking has several models and finishes and is suitable for all women who want to compose elegant looks, <br>
        especially in intimate moments or at night social events.<br>
        <br>
        Wear footless stocking with skirts or dresses and a thick coat on top, such as wool or leather. When your goal is to conquer <br>
        the cat, however, you can associate the sock with a corset or sensual costume, for example. <br>
        <br>
        Don't forget basic care, okay? Delicate items like a sock footless stocking to be hand washed after a few minutes <br>
        immersed in water. Avoid prolonged exposure to the sun, drying it in shady and ventilated places or in the early sun <br>
        day or late afternoon. <br>
