        <blockquote cite="http://blog.specialitalingerie.com.br">
        <p class="text">Some Brazilians opt for the gym, others prefer to do it at home, how to go hiking and running outdoors. <br>
        Regardless of the <b>choice</b> of each one, a question is very common among women: <br>
        which lingerie or panties to wear with gym clothes?</i> <br>
        <br>
        Panties with gym clothes: <b>Be careful with the seams </b><br>
        The vast majority of women look for panties of <i>comfortable</i> models and materials for use with gym clothes, <br>
        especially during physical exercise. <br>
        <br>
        The first choice of the female audience for this scenario is usually light fabric pieces, such as <i>cotton or microfiber </i>. <br>
        It is worth remembering that the greatest attention that should be given when making this decision is to opt for <b>sewing-free panties.</b> <br>
        That's because these models will not show the underwear mark on top of the gym clothes. <br>
        <br>
        Panties with gym clothes: <b>Thong panties? </b><br>
        Despite not being unanimous, a <b>quite</b> significant portion of the female population prefers the use of <i>thong underwear <br></i>
        with gym clothes. <br>
        <br>
        Without pretending to present <i>magical</i> solutions, or absolute and indisputable tips, it is essential that every woman has freedom <br>
        to choose the pieces you <b>want</b> from your wardrobe to use, even during gymnastics and physical activities. <br>
        <br>
        However, it is worth noting that the choice of thong with the use of gym clothes is an option that should be considered by women. <br>
        This is because, when using gym clothes, it is assumed that the woman will do physical activities and, in this way, <br>
        it is possible that the thong panties <i>hurt</i> you due to the movements made. <br>
        <br>
        As mentioned before, regardless of the material of the panties, it is interesting to look for models <b> <a class="link" href="/lang-en/post1-panties.html" target="_blank"> seamless</a></b>, <br>
        as these panties are usually more comfortable and do not leave marks on clothes. <br>
        <br>
        Why wear panties with gym clothes? <br>
        Just as there are some women who opt for lightweight fabric pieces and others opt for thong models, some women <br>
        prefer <b>not to wear</b> panties with gym clothes. <br>
        <br>
        It is known that the complete non-use of underwear is not <i>advised</i> by health professionals, especially among women <br>
        because their genitalia are open and therefore more susceptible to the entry of organisms that can cause <i>infections</i> or allergies. <br>
        <br>
        However, there is no evidence to show that not wearing panties for certain periods of time leads to health problems <br>
        On the contrary, several women report that this is the most comfortable way to do the exercises, in addition to not <br>
        having witnessed any kind of health problem arising from the habit of not wearing panties under gym clothes. <br>
        <br>
        What is the best? <br>
        For the answer to be coherent, it is necessary that the question is asked to the greatest expert in the subject: <b>you.</b> <br>
        <br>
        Only you can decide how best to handle panties and gym clothes. Do you prefer comfortable models? <br>
        Don't give up thongs panties? Do you think panties only get in the way of gym clothes and prefer not to use them? <br>
        Only you will be able to answer properly which option is best for you and your body. What do you think about it? <br>
